<h1 id="Part-1"><a href="#Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1"></a>Part 1</h1><h2 id="1-Health"><a href="#1-Health" class="headerlink" title="1.Health"></a><em><strong>1.Health</strong></em></h2><p><strong>How do you keep healthy?</strong></p>
<p>​	To keep healthy,I try to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly. I make sure to get enough nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. But in my opinion, the key to keep healthy is to have a healthy schedule and avoid stress.</p>
<p><strong>Do you often do exercises?</strong></p>
<p>​	Yeah, I do exercise regularly. I think it’s important to keep healthy with exercises instead just eating. I usually go for a run in school playground, but sometimes I also play badminton with my roommates. It helps me relieve stress and get more energized.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite sport?</strong></p>
<p>​	It’s obvious that my favorite sport is badminton. Don’t like basketball or soccer, it’s  safer and have less possible to get injured. In this case, it’s also competitive and exciting. Plus, it’s such an awesome workout and helps me unwind in school life.</p>
<p><strong>Are there health classes in your school?</strong></p>
<p>​	Actually I have health classes in our school. School provided us with classes cover topics like exercise and mental health. We usually have one class per week and it’s a good opportunity to learn how to take care of ourselves and stay healthy.</p>
<h1 id="Part-2-amp-3"><a href="#Part-2-amp-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2&amp;3"></a>Part 2&amp;3</h1><h2 id="1-important-decision"><a href="#1-important-decision" class="headerlink" title="1.important decision"></a><em><strong>1.important decision</strong></em></h2><p><strong>Describe a time when you had to make an important decision</strong><br><strong>You should say:</strong><br><strong>What decision you had to make</strong><br><strong>How you made the decision</strong><br><strong>Why this decision was important</strong><br><strong>And explain whether you think it was a right decision</strong></p>
<p>​	One of the most important decisions I had to made was choosing my major in college. It was a crucial crossroad in my life where I had to select a path to future.</p>
<p>​	To make this decision, I considered several aspects. Firstly, I started from my interests and disposition, I reflected on subjects that I enjoyed and felt motivated to study. Additionally, I researched the career prospects and job opportunities between different majors. What’s more, I sought advice from my parents,teachers and friends,which helped me gain a better perspective.</p>
<p>​	This decision was extremely important because it would shape my academic journey and impact my future career. Choosing the right major not only provided me with passions for learning knowledges and skills in this field,but also determined the direction of my future endeavors.</p>
<p>​	Looking back, I believe it was the right decision. I chose the software engineering that aligned with my interests and strengths. It sparked my curiosity and allowed me to explore a subject I was truly interested in. I feel fulfilled and content with the path I chose, and I’m excited about catching that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think children ever have to make important decisions?</strong></p>
<p>​	Absolutely. Children definitely have made important decisions, although they might not as significant as those made by adults. For instance,they might decide which activities to participate in or choose their friends wisely. These decisions may small, but they contribute to their personal growth. </p>
<p><strong>What important decisions do teenagers need to make after graduation?</strong></p>
<p>​	After graduation, teenagers face several crucial decisions. For example, they must choose between higher education and work directly. This affects their future prospects, so they need to consider their interests,skills and so on when selecting their path.</p>
<p><strong>Who can children turn to for help when making a decision?</strong></p>
<p>​	Children can turn to their parents, teachers, and friends for help when making decisions. Parents have experience and insights to offer, while teachers provide objective guidance based on their understanding of the child’s capabilities. Friends can also offer different advice and share personal experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think advertisements can influence our decisions when shopping?</strong></p>
<p>​	Absolutely. Advertisements have a huge impact on our shopping decisions. They catch our attention, create desire, and finally influence our choices. Plus, as we browsing in the internet, quantities of ads introducing new products and creating desires to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the influence of advertising is good?</strong></p>
<p>​	It’s hard to say, I think the influence of advertising is both positive and negative. On the one hand, advertising plays a significant role to promoting products and services, providing information to consumers. But it also misleading to impalsive buying or unrealistic expectations.</p>
