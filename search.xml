Finally, they should be able to concentrate and avoid wandering while driving.</p><p><strong>Do you think the government should make it a rule for people to use public transport?</strong></p><p>​I think it depends on the specific situation. In some cases, it may be beneficial for the government to encourage the use of public transport. However, making it a rule could be difficult to enforce and may not be feasible for everyone.  Additionally, some people may have personal reasons for needing a private vehicle, such as for work or family responsibilities.</p><h2 id="4-expensive-gift"><a href="#4-expensive-gift" class="headerlink" title="4.expensive gift"></a><em>4.<strong>expensive gift</strong></em></h2><p><strong>Describe an expensive gift that you would like to give someone</strong><br><strong>You should say:</strong><br><strong>What gift you would like to buy</strong><br><strong>Who you would like to give it to</strong><br><strong>How long it would take to save the money</strong><br><strong>And explain why you would like to give this expensive gift to this person.</strong></p><p>​Well, there’s an amazing gift I would love to give to my father. It’s actually a laptop. The particular one I want to buy is the latest Macbook, which has a 32G memory. It’s perfectly designed for users who have a     desire to convenience and have heavy works about document editing.</p><p>​I want to gift it to my father who usually has a need to modify documents at any time. He is now doing work on his laptop nearly 10 years old which is somewhat laggy.</p><p>​Apple is known for its expensive products. To make this dream gift a reality, I’ll need to save money diligently. Fortunately, I have a internship that allows me to save it a bit quicker. So I believe I can make it within 6 months if I didn’t spend too much on other unnecessary items.</p><p>​What’s more, I plan to give him a surprise on his birthday, which is exactly half year away. Hopefully I won’t mess it up and get the laptop in time.</p><p><strong>What do young people like to save money for?</strong></p><p>​Well,young people these days save up for various reasons.  Some save money to buy something like smartphones or games. Others save for travel, exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. It really depends on their interests and goals.</p><p><strong>ls it easy for people to save money to buy something expensive?</strong></p><p>​Not really. Saving up for something can be quite a challenge, especially for Chinese college students because they have limited income and various expenses. However, with discipline it’s definitely possible and maybe even taking up part-time job or internship to speed up the saving process.</p><p><strong>Should children have pocket money? Why?</strong></p><pre><code> Absolutely! Giving children pocket money is beneficial for their development. It teaches them financial responsibility and helps them learn about budgeting. With their own money, they can make choices and learn from the consequences.</code></pre><p><strong>Should children learn how to use money at school or from their parents?</strong></p><p>​Well, I think it’s important for children to learn about money both at school and from their parents. Schools can provide a curriculum that teaches the basics of personal finance while parents play a crucial role in teaching money management skills through day-to-day experiences.</p><p><strong>How do people save money?</strong></p><p>​Well, there are various ways people save money. One common strategy is to cut back on unnecessary expenses. For example, they cook at home instead eating out. Additionally, they can try to find part-time jobs to earn extra income.</p><p><strong>Why can’t some people save money?</strong></p><p>​Some people struggle to save money because of high living expenses.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在瓦罗兰特中暴徒和幻象是两把主战步枪，虽然暴徒要求更高的急停时间和更大的扩散，但是其不会衰减伤害的特性和爆头一发让人爱不释手。虽然游戏中没有更改武器属性的皮肤，但皮肤的模型，音效和击杀反馈仍会使武器的手感有细微的差别，下面我会按照时间对暴徒的特效皮肤进行点评。</p><h2 id="1-紫金狂潮"><a href="#1-紫金狂潮" class="headerlink" title="1.紫金狂潮"></a>1.紫金狂潮</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/zjkcbaotu4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/zjkcbaotu4.mp4</a></p><p>经典之作，独特的换弹动作让人感觉非常解压，作为第一款全特效皮肤，紫金的枪声和手感至今仍是上乘，但模型质感和炫彩细节等现在看比较粗糙。</p><h2 id="2-至尊龙炎"><a href="#2-至尊龙炎" class="headerlink" title="2.至尊龙炎"></a>2.至尊龙炎</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/zzlybt1004.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/zzlybt1004.mp4</a></p><p>第一款真正意义上的全特效皮肤，在切枪、换弹和开火都有龙的特点体现。手感褒贬不一，同系列的其他几款单发武器好评更多。</p><h2 id="3-掠夺印象"><a href="#3-掠夺印象" class="headerlink" title="3.掠夺印象"></a>3.掠夺印象</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/LDYX4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/LDYX4.mp4</a></p><p>被称为性价比之王的系列，沉重的枪声和击杀音效搭配酷炫的换弹动作让人欲罢不能，可能在模型上有些诟病，但掠夺绝对是ak的前几名。</p><h2 id="4-电幻普普"><a href="#4-电幻普普" class="headerlink" title="4.电幻普普"></a>4.电幻普普</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/DHPP4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/DHPP4.mp4</a></p><p>电幻的暴徒评价可以说是两极分化，伸缩枪头的设计以及沙哑空洞的枪声可能不被一部分人接受，但我很喜欢它精致的炫彩、枪身光效以及终结特效，可以说是非常值的一套皮肤。</p><h2 id="5-弃王遗思"><a href="#5-弃王遗思" class="headerlink" title="5.弃王遗思"></a>5.弃王遗思</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/QWYS4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/QWYS4.mp4</a></p><p>与掠夺手感相似却不同，少了些许侵略性而多了一种凌厉感，白金色的炫彩也是加分项。</p><h2 id="6-起源"><a href="#6-起源" class="headerlink" title="6.起源"></a>6.起源</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/QY4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/QY4.mp4</a></p><p>独特的检视动作是它的代名词，搭配上清脆明亮的枪声让他在单点射击中首屈一指，但枪声太硬也让他不适合泼水。</p><h2 id="7-光之哨兵"><a href="#7-光之哨兵" class="headerlink" title="7.光之哨兵"></a>7.光之哨兵</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/GZSB4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/GZSB4.mp4</a></p><p>和英雄联盟的联动套装，设计核心是光明圣石，手感偏硬，但配色和终结特效好评如潮，美中不足的是切枪时的旋转特效太慢，感觉掏枪比别的ak慢很多。</p><h2 id="8-RGX-显卡"><a href="#8-RGX-显卡" class="headerlink" title="8.RGX 显卡"></a>8.RGX 显卡</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/RGX5.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/RGX5.mp4</a></p><p>音效就像红轴，非常丝滑，点头和泼水的手感都不错，搭配透明枪身和旋转的机械轴以及每次检视换色让他成为一款非常优秀的皮肤。</p><h2 id="9-2021冠军赛"><a href="#9-2021冠军赛" class="headerlink" title="9.2021冠军赛"></a>9.2021冠军赛</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/2021gjs4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/2021gjs4.mp4</a></p><p>虽然没有改模型和音效，但是动效的champion和顶级的音效特效让它成为顶级暴徒的一员，也是暴徒中唯一一款可以检视听歌的。</p><h2 id="10-盖亚复仇"><a href="#10-盖亚复仇" class="headerlink" title="10.盖亚复仇"></a>10.盖亚复仇</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/GYFC4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/GYFC4.mp4</a></p><p>如果说显卡ak是红轴，那么盖亚ak就是青轴，段落感和清脆的枪声让单点的手感直线上升，几款炫彩和终结特效更是精美绝伦。</p><h2 id="11-海洋星球"><a href="#11-海洋星球" class="headerlink" title="11.海洋星球"></a>11.海洋星球</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/HYXQ3.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/HYXQ3.mp4</a></p><p>软ak的代表，在手感绝佳的同时增加了趣味性，给人夏天玩滋水枪的感觉，透明的枪身和鱼缸的设计好看又不影响视野，唯一的缺憾是没有终结特效，但仍瑕不掩瑜。</p><h2 id="12-混沌序幕"><a href="#12-混沌序幕" class="headerlink" title="12.混沌序幕"></a>12.混沌序幕</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/HDXM4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/HDXM4.mp4</a></p><p>神中神，换弹和检视都是让人眼前一亮的创新，失真电吉他的音效更是带劲，非常有力量感的一款皮肤。</p><h2 id="13-虚无时界"><a href="#13-虚无时界" class="headerlink" title="13.虚无时界"></a>13.虚无时界</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/XWSJ4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/XWSJ4.mp4</a></p><p>枪声均衡的代表，和显卡类似，但ak和这个球的适配不是很好，炫彩的配色也差强人意，让他在ak排行榜上略逊于其他皮肤。</p><h2 id="14-离子圣芒"><a href="#14-离子圣芒" class="headerlink" title="14.离子圣芒"></a>14.离子圣芒</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/LZSM4.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/LZSM4.mp4</a></p><p>虽然也是枪身带球，但是看起来比虚无匀称的多，枪身也继承了离子系列的轻盈，几款炫彩也能带来不一样的感觉。</p><h2 id="15-异星霸主"><a href="#15-异星霸主" class="headerlink" title="15.异星霸主"></a>15.异星霸主</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/yxbzbt1004hc2.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/yxbzbt1004hc2.mp4</a></p><p>生物科技风的枪身十分讨喜，混响很高的枪声因人而异，三款炫彩也是加分项，和混沌都是重ak的典范。</p><h2 id="16-恶鬼"><a href="#16-恶鬼" class="headerlink" title="16.恶鬼"></a>16.恶鬼</h2><p><a href="https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/egbt1004.mp4">https://video.gamersky.com/new/zhuanti/2023/valorantSkin/egbt1004.mp4</a></p><p>继承了恶鬼系列一向优秀的手感，恶鬼ak类似木棒敲击的声音让人眼前一亮，但在众多顶级ak皮肤的比较中也只能排行在第二梯队。</p>]]></content>
